I am a third year Ph.D. student major in computer science at
the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)
in Tsinghua University.
I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yao/), who is the
A.M. Turing laureate of 2000. I received my B.S. degree in computer science from Peking University in 2021, advised by
Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com).

My research focuses on machine learning, both on theoretical side and application side. My current research
focuses on establishing theoretical guarantees of generalization and optimization of deep learning algorithms.
I have previously worked on topics including adversarial robustness, federated learning and differential
privacy.
